I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=2, end_char_idx=1983, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), TextNode(id_='27f06529-5fed-431d-b74d-cddb460365c0', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/wilson/工作文档/rag 调优 50 讲/playbook/09/data.txt', 'file_name': 'data.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 75041, 'creation_date': '2025-07-14', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-14'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5e6ef38f-2527-495c-b1c7-51c15dda049c', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/wilson/工作文档/rag 调优 50 讲/playbook/09/data.txt', 'file_name': 'data.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 75041, 'creation_date': '2025-07-14', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-14'}, hash='a593f154975f49e38a1ef0d34c333849d0c30df928e0871d339774747363b04a'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6f11a4c3-80a5-4c82-a12c-f473132aa474', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/wilson/工作文档/rag 调优 50 讲/playbook/09/data.txt', 'file_name': 'data.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 75041, 'creation_date': '2025-07-14', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-14'}, hash='69b25f03f15c7c80f30980968d2c9151d88ac0b97d553ab5f83c00a630ef5218'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ba5c39c2-b3ab-44e2-9a34-5782897eb0dd', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='c8d417673ba8dadb7be73dc07d0533bf0c3aab4206103c59a7ed3bed7d781312')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"I was puzzled by the 1401.

In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.\\n\\nI couldn't have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept being boring.

I kept the code tight and didn\\'t have to integrate with any other software except Robert\\'s and Trevor\\'s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I\\'d had to do was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were instead the most stressful.\\n\\nThere were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn\\'t because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.\\n\\nWe did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example, we did what\\'s now called \"doing things that don\\'t scale,\" although at the time we would have described it as \"being so lame that we\\'re driven to the most desperate measures to get users.\" The most common of which was building stores for them.

Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life.

      "Paul Graham traces how his interests evolved from writing short stories and early programming (punch-card Fortran on an IBM 1401) to microcomputers, where interactive programming hooked him. In college he initially pursued philosophy, found it unsatisfying, and pivoted to AI, learning Lisp and even reverse-engineering SHRDLU—until graduate school convinced him that symbolic AI of the era was fundamentally limited. He then doubled down on Lisp and building things, writing On Lisp, while also growing dissatisfied with how quickly software becomes obsolete.\n",
      "\n",
      "A turning point came when he realized art can last, leading him to study painting (RISD, Florence) and juggle identities as a CS PhD student, Lisp hacker, and aspiring artist. After returning to the U.S. and working at Interleaf, he absorbed practical lessons about product, culture, and the idea that “low end eats high end.” He later co-founded Viaweb, discovering early the power of web apps (server-side software controlled through a browser), and sold the company to Yahoo—gaining wealth but also burnout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Post-Yahoo, he returned to painting, then re-entered tech with new insights about web platforms and programming languages (Arc, later Bel). Publishing essays online became another major inflection point: he realized the web removed traditional gatekeepers, enabling a new era of essay writing and shaping his long-term direction. His experiences and principles eventually contributed to founding Y Combinator, whose batch model emerged partly from experimentation and ignorance of conventional VC norms. After years of intense work, he stepped back from YC, returned to writing and coding (notably the long Bel project), and reflects on a recurring theme: working on “unprestigious” things often led to the most interesting opportunities and the most authentic motivation.\n",
      "Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It's the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "[3] I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery, and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "[4] You can of course paint people like still lives if you want to, and they're willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce pained expressions in the sitters.\n",
      "\n",
      "[5] Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore's Law. In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e. Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies like a bulldozer.\n",
      "\n",
      "[6] The signature style seekers at RISD weren't specifically mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled. Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "[7] Technically the apartment wasn't rent-controlled but rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less than half market price.\n",
      "\n",
      "[8] Most software you can launch as soon as it's done. But when the software is an online store builder and you're hosting the stores, if you don't have any users yet, that fact will be painfully obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and making sure they had decent-looking stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "[9] We'd had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their own page styles. They didn't know it, but they were editing Lisp expressions underneath. But this wasn't an app editor, because the code ran when the merchants' sites were generated, not when shoppers visited them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[10] This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was better than other languages? Weren't they all Turing complete? People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me how sorry they feel for me, but I'm not exaggerating when I reply that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they don't already know, and some people dislike being told such things.\n",
      "\n",
      "[11] People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as the (or at least a) primary version.\n",
      "\n",
      "[12] There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays, been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap and common, but the VCs' customs still reflected the old world, just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints of the print era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e. less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an interesting point, though: you can't always predict which fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay writing would be?\n",
      "\n",
      "[13] Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were called Cambridge Seed. But we didn't want a regional name, in case someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked orange as our color partly because it's the warmest, and partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.\n",
